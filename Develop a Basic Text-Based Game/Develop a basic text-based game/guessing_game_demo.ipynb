    "## Project Description\n",
    "This project demonstrates a basic text-based number guessing game implemented in Python. The user tries to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 10. The game provides feedback after each guess and continues until the correct number is guessed.\n",

    "### How to Run\n",
    "- Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.\n",
    "- Run the script `guessing_game.py` in your terminal:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  python guessing_game.py\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Alternatively, use the notebook cells below to interactively play the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Rules\n",
    "- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 10.\n",
    "- You enter your guess.\n",
    "- The game will tell you if your guess is too low, too high, or out of range.\n",
    "- Keep guessing until you find the correct number.\n",
    "- The game will display the number of attempts taken.\n",
