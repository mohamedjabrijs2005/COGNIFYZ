**Description:**
This project demonstrates how to generate and print simple number patterns using Python loops. The user can select from multiple pattern types and specify the number of rows. The patterns include:

- Left-aligned triangle
- Right-aligned triangle
- Pyramid
- Inverted pyramid

## How to Use

1. Run the `number_pyramid.py` script.
2. Select the desired pattern by entering a number (1-4).
3. Enter the number of rows for the pattern.
4. The selected pattern will be printed in the console.

## Example Output

```
Select a number pattern to print:
1. Left-aligned triangle
2. Right-aligned triangle
3. Pyramid
4. Inverted pyramid
Enter your choice (1-4): 3
Enter the number of rows: 5
    1 
   1 2 
  1 2 3 
 1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5 
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Files
- `number_pyramid.py`: Main script to generate patterns.
- `README.md`: Project description and usage instructions.
